    What is HTML : 
            hypertext markup language
            used to tell the browser what to display
            creates structure for display

        HTML IS NOT A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE; no logic

    in HTML we use tags
        they are standardized by w3c - world wide web consortium

        opening tags ---- > <tagName> 
        closing tags ---- > </tagName>
        self closing tags --- > <tagName/>

        for the first tag -- > telling browser what kind of documment it will browser

-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<! -- the rest tells the browser what it needs -->

<html>

<! -- now we need to give the browser information about the document 
(metadata) -->

<head>

        <!-- the head is where al of the meta data is going to go
            this is information about the data inside your document
                such as information for languages, stuff for seo, scripts, styles, etc
         -->

         <title>
            this is our first hmtl page
        </title>

<meta charset="UTF-8"/>

<!--

     what is an attribute?
        a property of an element that changes the behavior and /or appearance.

    what is the difference a tag and an element?
        a tag is just a ta: <tag>

        however, an element has both opening and closing tags with content
            in between. Essentially it is the coplete thought, if it is 
            self closing  it is an element and a tag.

        tags: table, thead for the head section of the table
